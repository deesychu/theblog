                <p>One thing I loved about the Sunnies Face Lip Glaze was how it brought life to my pale, chapped lips with the perfect wash of color, while the metal applicator smoothed everything out. But if I’m being honest, the scent? Not my favorite. It smelled too artificial and metallic. While I’m not looking for an exact dupe, I do want a new pink lip balm that checks off the things I liked from Sunnies Face.</p>

                <p>In this blog, I will be reviewing 4 lippies. To find the <em>perfect pink lip balm</em>, I’ll be judging each lippie based on five key factors:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Formula & Hydration: </strong>Must be a true lip balm or serum (no oils or glosses) that keeps lips soft and moisturized.</li>
                    <li><strong>Color Payoff: </strong>A sheer baby or strawberry pink—just enough tint without going overboard.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Texture & Comfort:</strong>Lightweight and smooth—no stickiness or heavy feel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Packaging & Application: </strong>Easy-to-use applicator with mess-free, convenient packaging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Value for Money: </strong>Does the price match the quality and amount of product? ($/oz)</li>
                </ol>

                <p>If you’ve ever dreamed of slathering your lips on a freshly glazed donut, then this lip serum might just be your perfect match. I was so excited to try this because it’s a new release, but does it live up to the hype? <em>Let’s break it down!</em>

                            <summary><strong>✅ High-Shine Tint</strong></summary>
                            <p>The shine is next-level—it gave my lips that plump, glazed-donut effect we all love. Plus, the pigment was surprisingly rich, delivering a peachy-pink tint that made my lips look extra juicy. The consistency is thicker than your average gloss, so one swipe is enough, but layering more won’t make your lips feel sticky or heavy.</p>
                        </details>
                        <details>
                            <summary><strong>✅ A Deliciously Sweet Scent</strong></summary>
                            <p>The Peach Glaze scent is yummy, but not exactly peachy—it actually smells more like a freshly baked good. It’s sweet, subtle, and not overpowering or artificial, so every application feels like a mini dessert moment for your lips.</p>
                        </details>
                        <details>
                            <summary><strong>✅ Plush Donut Applicator</strong></summary>
                            <p>This lip serum comes with an adorable, plush donut-shaped applicator—something I’ve never seen in a lip product before! It felt a little odd at first, but the soft, rounded shape makes application super smooth, creating a plush, pillowy effect that makes reapplying even more satisfying. It’s like kissing a donut!</p>
                        </details>
                        <details>
                            <summary><strong>✅ Made in Korea</strong></summary>
                            <p>Since this lip serum is made in Korea, it’s packed with skincare benefits. It contains polypeptides to hydrate and nourish your lips, so while it gives instant shine, it’s also working behind the scenes to keep your lips soft and healthy.</p>

                            <p>As gorgeous as Peach Glaze is, the shade range is very limited. I was hoping for a baby pink or cool-toned option, but most of the shades are darker and more pigmented. Since it’s a new release, I’m hoping they expand the shade selection soon!</p>

                            <summary><strong>❌ Not For Chapped Lips</strong></summary>
                            <p>I tested this lip serum in snowy weather, and unfortunately, it didn’t cling well to my dry lips. If you have super chapped lips, the formula settles into fine lines and fades pretty quickly. It’s definitely better as a glossy finish than a true lip balm replacement.</p>

            <p>At $22 for 12g, that comes out to $1.83 per gram, making it pricier than the average lip product. However, if you love a juicy, high-shine gloss with K-beauty lip care benefits, it’s a fun, indulgent buy! Bottom line? It’s a stunning gloss, but don’t expect it to replace your go-to lip balm.</p>

                            <summary><strong>✅ Strawberry Scent & Mauve Pink</strong></summary>
                            <p>The scent is easily one of my favorites—it smells like sweet, juicy strawberries without being too artificial or overwhelming. And the mauve-pink tint? Absolutely perfect! It’s that just-right pink—not too light, not too dark, and universally flattering on all skin tones.
                            </p>
                        </details>
                        <details>
                            <summary><strong>✅ Fuller, Softer, Bouncier Lips</strong></summary>
                            <p>This doesn’t sting or feel like a plumping gloss, yet somehow, it makes my lips look fuller and healthier. The hydration is next level, giving my lips a smoother, more pillowy look. It’s basically your lips but with a juicy boost!</p>
                        </details>
                        <details>
                            <summary><strong>✅ Long-Lasting & Super Hydrating</strong></summary>
                            <p>One thing I really loved was how long-lasting this is. It didn’t just sit on top of my lips—it actually helped reduce dryness and flakiness. If you struggle with fine lines or chapped lips, this blurs them out, leaving your lips looking soft and nourished all day.</p>
                        </details>

                            <p>While it’s super hydrating, the formula is thicker than expected—almost like a lip gloss. It’s not unbearably sticky, but if you don’t like thicker lip products, this might not be for you.
                            </p>
                        </details>
                        <details>
                            <summary><strong>❌ Tough Applicator</strong></summary>
                            <p> I actually love an angled applicator, but this one felt a little too stiff. I had to apply a bit more pressure than I’d like, which made the application feel less smooth.
                            </p>
                        </details>
                        <details>
                            <summary><strong>❌ Not Much Product for the Price</strong></summary>
                            <p>: At $22 for 11.5g, this comes out to $1.91 per gram, making it the smallest amount of product on my list. While it’s high quality, I do wish there was more product for the price.</p>

                            <summary><strong>✅ Strawberry Scent & Mauve Pink</strong></summary>
                            <p>The scent is easily one of my favorites—it smells like sweet, juicy strawberries without being too artificial or overwhelming. And the mauve-pink tint? Absolutely perfect! It’s that just-right pink—not too light, not too dark, and universally flattering on all skin tones.
                            </p>

                            <summary><strong>✅ Fuller, Softer, Bouncier Lips</strong></summary>
                            <p>This doesn’t sting or feel like a plumping gloss, yet somehow, it makes my lips look fuller and healthier. The hydration is next level, giving my lips a smoother, more pillowy look. It’s basically your lips but with a juicy boost!</p>

                            <summary><strong>✅ Long-Lasting & Super Hydrating</strong></summary>
                            <p>One thing I really loved was how long-lasting this is. It didn’t just sit on top of my lips—it actually helped reduce dryness and flakiness. If you struggle with fine lines or chapped lips, this blurs them out, leaving your lips looking soft and nourished all day.</p>

                        <details>
                            <summary><strong>❌ Thick & Sticky Consistency</strong></summary>
                            <p>While it’s super hydrating, the formula is thicker than expected—almost like a lip gloss. It’s not unbearably sticky, but if you don’t like thicker lip products, this might not be for you.

                            <summary><strong>❌ Tough Applicator</strong></summary>
                            <p> I actually love an angled applicator, but this one felt a little too stiff. I had to apply a bit more pressure than I’d like, which made the application feel less smooth.

                            <summary><strong>❌ Not Much Product for the Price</strong></summary>
                            <p>: At $22 for 11.5g, this comes out to $1.91 per gram, making it the smallest amount of product on my list. While it’s high quality, I do wish there was more product for the price.</p>
