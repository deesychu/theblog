                <p>One thing I loved about the Sunnies Face Lip Glaze was how it brought life to my pale, chapped lips with the perfect wash of color, while the metal applicator smoothed everything out. But if I‚Äôm being honest, the scent? Not my favorite. It smelled too artificial and metallic. While I‚Äôm not looking for an exact dupe, I do want a new pink lip balm that checks off the things I liked from Sunnies Face.</p>

                <p>In this blog, I will be reviewing 4 lippies. To find the <em>perfect pink lip balm</em>, I‚Äôll be judging each lippie based on five key factors:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Formula & Hydration: </strong>Must be a true lip balm or serum (no oils or glosses) that keeps lips soft and moisturized.</li>
                    <li><strong>Color Payoff: </strong>A sheer baby or strawberry pink‚Äîjust enough tint without going overboard.
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Texture & Comfort:</strong> Lightweight and smooth‚Äîno stickiness or heavy feel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Packaging & Application: </strong>Easy-to-use applicator with mess-free, convenient packaging.</li>
                    <li><strong>Value for Money: </strong>Does the price match the quality and amount of product? ($/oz)</li>

                <p>If you‚Äôve ever dreamed of slathering your lips on a freshly glazed donut, then this lip serum might just be your perfect match. I was so excited to try this because it‚Äôs a new release, but does it live up to the hype? <em>Let‚Äôs break it down!</em>

                            <summary><strong>‚úÖ High-Shine Tint</strong></summary>
                            <p>The shine is next-level‚Äîit gave my lips that plump, glazed-donut effect we all love. Plus, the pigment was surprisingly rich, delivering a peachy-pink tint that made my lips look extra juicy. The consistency is thicker than your average gloss, so one swipe is enough, but layering more won‚Äôt make your lips feel sticky or heavy.</p>
                        </details>
                        <details>

                            <p>The Peach Glaze scent is yummy, but not exactly peachy‚Äîit actually smells more like a freshly baked good. It‚Äôs sweet, subtle, and not overpowering or artificial, so every application feels like a mini dessert moment for your lips.</p>
                        </details>

                            <p>This lip serum comes with an adorable, plush donut-shaped applicator‚Äîsomething I‚Äôve never seen in a lip product before! It felt a little odd at first, but the soft, rounded shape makes application super smooth, creating a plush, pillowy effect that makes reapplying even more satisfying. It‚Äôs like kissing a donut!</p>

                            <p>Since this lip serum is made in Korea, it‚Äôs packed with skincare benefits. It contains polypeptides to hydrate and nourish your lips, so while it gives instant shine, it‚Äôs also working behind the scenes to keep your lips soft and healthy.</p>

                            <p>As gorgeous as Peach Glaze is, the shade range is very limited. I was hoping for a baby pink or cool-toned option, but most of the shades are darker and more pigmented. Since it‚Äôs a new release, I‚Äôm hoping they expand the shade selection soon!</p>

                            <p>I tested this lip serum in snowy weather, and unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt cling well to my dry lips. If you have super chapped lips, the formula settles into fine lines and fades pretty quickly. It‚Äôs definitely better as a glossy finish than a true lip balm replacement.</p>

            <p>At $22 for 12g, that comes out to $1.83 per gram, making it pricier than the average lip product. However, if you love a juicy, high-shine gloss with K-beauty lip care benefits, it‚Äôs a fun, indulgent buy! Bottom line? It‚Äôs a stunning gloss, but don‚Äôt expect it to replace your go-to lip balm.</p>

                            <p>The scent is easily one of my favorites‚Äîit smells like sweet, juicy strawberries without being too artificial or overwhelming. And the mauve-pink tint? Absolutely perfect! It‚Äôs that just-right pink‚Äînot too light, not too dark, and universally flattering on all skin tones.

                            <p>This doesn‚Äôt sting or feel like a plumping gloss, yet somehow, it makes my lips look fuller and healthier. The hydration is next level, giving my lips a smoother, more pillowy look. It‚Äôs basically your lips but with a juicy boost!</p>

                            <p>One thing I really loved was how long-lasting this is. It didn‚Äôt just sit on top of my lips‚Äîit actually helped reduce dryness and flakiness. If you struggle with fine lines or chapped lips, this blurs them out, leaving your lips looking soft and nourished all day.</p>

                            <p>While it‚Äôs super hydrating, the formula is thicker than expected‚Äîalmost like a lip gloss. It‚Äôs not unbearably sticky, but if you don‚Äôt like thicker lip products, this might not be for you.

                            <p> I actually love an angled applicator, but this one felt a little too stiff. I had to apply a bit more pressure than I‚Äôd like, which made the application feel less smooth.

                <h2> Tower 28 LipSoftie Hydrating Tinted Lip Treatment Balm
                </h2>
                <p>Tower 28 is one of my favorite makeup brands, and honestly, I think it‚Äôs so underrated. More people should be talking about them! But when it comes to their lip treatments, do I love them as much as the rest of their products? <em>Let‚Äôs break it down!</em>

                            <summary><strong>‚úÖ A Shade for Everyone</strong></summary>
                            <p>One thing I have to give Tower 28 credit for is its diverse shade range. Unlike some brands that only release two or three basic colors, they actually have shades I want in a lip product. Plus, the tones seem to be universally flattering, so they look great on all lips.

                            <summary><strong>‚úÖ Affordable Lip Balm</strong></summary>
                            <p>At $16 for 10.77g, or $1.48 per gram, it‚Äôs the cheapest option among higher-end lip balms. If you want something budget-friendly but still feels luxe, this one‚Äôs got you covered. Most Sephora lip balms cost over $20, this is one of the affordable alternatives.

                            <summary><strong>‚úÖ Fruity Scent (Not Overpowering)</strong></summary>
                            <p>The scent is fruity and fresh, which I enjoyed! It‚Äôs not too strong, though I do prefer other scents over fruity ones. If you‚Äôre someone who loves tropical, juicy-smelling lip products, this might be right up your alley. </p>

                            <summary><strong>‚ùå Hard, Round Applicator</strong></summary>
                            <p>The applicator is round and a little too firm, making it harder to spread the product evenly on my lips. I prefer plushier, angled applicators, so this one didn‚Äôt give me the smoothest application experience.
                            </p>

                            <summary><strong>‚ùå Doesn‚Äôt Last Long</strong></summary>
                            <p>I found myself reapplying constantly because it fades quickly. I also noticed that when I tried layering it over my lip liner or other lip products, it rubbed them off instead of blending smoothly. So, I‚Äôd recommend wearing this balm on its own rather than trying to mix it with other products.
                            </p>

                            <summary><strong>‚ùå Drying & Grainy</strong></summary>
                            <p> I was expecting more hydration, but instead, the formula felt a bit drying‚Äîespecially in cold weather. It also left some residue on the sides of my mouth, which wasn‚Äôt the cutest look. To be fair, I tested it during snowy weather, so maybe the winter chill played a role. But either way, I wish it were a bit more nourishing.

            <p>It‚Äôs not a bad product, but it‚Äôs not amazing either. For $16, it‚Äôs a decent, budget-friendly lip balm if you‚Äôre looking for a sheer, tinted option with a fruity scent. However, there are several cons more than the others and you might want to save your money and splurge on something else. Would I repurchase? Probably not. But it‚Äôs still a great lippie!
